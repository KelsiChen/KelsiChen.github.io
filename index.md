## Welcome 

My name is Chenyanxi, you can also call my English name, Kelsi. 
I am a freshmen with a department of Biomedical Science at ZJU-UoE institute, Zhejiang University. It is really a pleasure for me to join the IBI1 class.
Influenced by my aunt and uncle, who are both PhD in biology field, I was attracted by biology when I was young. Although did not get a satisfied grade in my National College Entrance Examination, I'm still really lucky to enter this school. Considering the Strong international education atmosphere, I study hard and try to brodon my horison to find the field I'm really interested in. 
I'm now joining in a laboratory, whose major research direction is human embryonic stem cells. I hope I could become a mature scientist in the future, designing useful drugs and treatments for our world.
